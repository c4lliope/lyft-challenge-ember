# Rideshare Resolver

This project, hosted at [lyft.graysonwright.com], is an EmberJS implementation
of [Lyft]'s programming challenge for prospective software engineers:

The problem, as stated on the job posting:

> Calculate the detour distance between two different rides.
> Given four latitude / longitude pairs, where driver one is traveling from
> point A to point B and driver two is traveling from point C to point D,
> write a function (in your language of choice) to calculate the shorter
> of the detour distances the drivers would need to take to pick-up and
> drop-off the other driver.

Now, normally my "language of choice would mean Ruby, and I did start out by
building [a simple command-line tool in Ruby] that would solved the problem.
Since I use Ruby every day for my actual work, it was pretty easy and I learned
almost nothing from doing it.

Ember, on the other hand, I have very little experience with, and I've been
wanting to dive into and learn the framework for a while. I figured it would be
easier and more fun for the Lyft team to judge a submission with a nice map
attached, and I'd get a chance to learn the Google Maps API! Really, no
downsides at all.

## Disclaimers

That being said, this is my first project in EmberJS, so I make no guarantees
about the quality of the code within. If you're someone from Lyft who's looking
for an actual sample of code I might write, I'd point you to [my Ruby solution].
That one was well-planned, TDD'd, and won't give you a headache to look at
(none of which apply to this project).
